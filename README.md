# TDT4240_progark_prosjekt

## Structure

You will find the main parts of the code under core/src/com/mygdx/game/.
In this folder you will see four classes, a package for all the sprites, and a package for all the states.
The four classes not contained within one of the packages are dealing with higher level tasks and can not be classified as either a state nor a sprite. This is the MyGdxGame.java module, dealing with general application tasks, and the FireBaseInterface.java and CoreInterfaceClass.java modules, which both deal with the communication to the Firebase server. 

Naturally, all java files contain a single class each.
